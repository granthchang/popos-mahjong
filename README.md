# Popo's Mahjong (2022)

- Traditional Shanghai mahjong brought from the tabletop to a free online format built for all players. Popo’s Mahjong hides the confusing processes and technicalities of traditional mahjong in the background so that the player can focus on what matters: winning. The game is built to be both an intuitive online platform for traditional players and a good introductory way to learn traditional mahjong for new players.
