# Popo's Mahjong

- Currently in development. Releasing early 2022.

- Traditional Shanghai mahjong brought from the tabletop to a free online format built for all players. Popoâ€™s Mahjong hides the confusing processes and technicalities of traditional mahjong in the background so that the player can focus on what matters: winning. The game is built to be both an intuitive online platform for traditional players and a good introductory way to learn traditional mahjong for new players.
